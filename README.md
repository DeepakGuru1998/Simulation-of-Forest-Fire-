# Simulation-of-Forest-Fire-
This repository provides the simulation of forest fires and compute the density graph of the forest. The rank-frequency plot of the distributions of two types of forests with different hyper parameters are compared and analused. The maximum log-likelihood estimator is used to estimate the exponent.
